All the tasks:-

GET /users-  List all users       ✅ Done (Milestone 1)
 
GET /users/1 ->get the user with id=1
GET /users/2 ->get the user with id=2

POST/users-->Create a new user

PATCH/user/1-->Edit the user with id=1

DELETE/users/1--->Delete the user with id=1

//for these we need data from db
//but we dont have any db for now
//

//Update -1:  GET/api/user --->will render a json data    ✅ Done
              GET/user-->will render a HTML doc with all users listed ✅Done
        so /api/  dewa mane we want json data .

Note -1:  GET /users/1 -->get info of user 1
          GET/user/787  -->get info of user 787
          Now we can't hardcode get req handler for all this individual path of /user/(id=x)
          So the id is actually a DYNAMIC PATH PARAMETRE 

          Getting this dynamic path paramtere (param):  [ : lagano gulokei param bole, multiple param thakte pare]
          const id = req.param.id
          then apply filter or find function in your json array of object to find the obj with id=x
          then return it as res.json()
    
GET /users/1 ->get the user with id=1   ✅Done
GET /users/2 ->get the user with id=2   ✅Done


Update -2:

GET /users/2 ->get the user with id=2
PATCH/user/1-->Edit the user with id=1
DELETE/users/1--->Delete the user with id=1   
You can see the path is same for all just the req method is diff
so we can merge these 3 by mentioning only 1 path and 3 req methods

like app.route(" ").get((req,res)=>{    }).patch((req,res)=>{}).delete((req,res)=>{   })

PATCH/user/1-->Edit the user with id=1  ✅Done
DELETE/users/1--->Delete the user with id=1  ✅Done


Note 3:  There is no way to send a POST req through a browser
so we need a differenet s/w to send a post req to our server  -> index.js
